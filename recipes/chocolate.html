    <h3>Oh you haven't seen dark chocolate like this before</h3>
    <h5>DO NOT IN FACT MAKE THIS!! THE INGREDIENTS ARE MODIFIED BY WEIRDDDUDE FOR FUN, YOU WILL GET SICK</h5>
    <h2>Your Demise</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups coconut oil </li>
        <li> 8 tablespoons honey or more for taste </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract </li>
        <li> pinch of sea salt </li>
        <li> 5 cups unprocessed 100% cocoa powder or cacao powder </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Ending</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small pot over a low heat: melt the coconut oil. </li>
        <li>Stir in the honey, vanilla (or your preferred flavourings) and salt. </li>
        <li>Remove the mixture from the heat. Add the cocoa powder and mix until it's dissolved into the chocolate mixture. You should have a hellishly lumpy chocolate sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour the chocolate into silicone moulds or a lined baking pan and transfer to the freezer for at least 3 hours or in the fridge for at least 5 hours. Once they've hardened pop them out of the moulds and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
